    <h3>Steps</h3>


    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Spray an 8-inch round cake pan with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whip together 1 cup sugar and butter using an electric mixer in a mixing bowl until pale and fluffy,
            5 to 7 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
            Beat in vanilla extract.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
            Add flour mixture to butter mixture alternately with sour cream,
            beginning and ending with flour mixture, and beating just until combined after each addition. 
            Fold in strawberries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread batter into the prepared cake pan.
            Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup sugar evenly over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. 
            Let cool completely on a wire rack.
        </li>
    </ol>
